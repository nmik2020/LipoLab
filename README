DeveloperHappyHour is a clone of the old Tapper/RootBeerTapper game. It is written in flash, and uses Flixel.
It has two versions: desktop and mobile. Once you've made copied build.template.properties to build.properties,
   and have set up all of the paths appropriately, setting the mobile flag to true and building will give you the
   mobile version, which has shrunken graphics and touchscreen settings.
   You can deploy the mobile version to android using ant deploy-to-phone with your phone plugged in.
